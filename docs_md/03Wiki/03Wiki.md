We also need to decide if we want a wiki and what it will consist of. I've notice 
2 repos on the Eagle-Warrior site. One is public and the other is private. On 
the free plan as I understand it you can not have a wiki on a private repo.

If we desire a public facing wiki we will need to decide what it should and should not contain.

Github allows wikis to be cloned by appending 'wiki.git' to the repo url. But 
because we have a free account this can only be done on a public repo.

Although posting a wiki with documentation on GitHub may not be the best 
solution, this provides a practical way to include documentation. Unfortunately,
creating links to markdown documents in the GitHub wiki does not always show 
the document in preview mode, Some links revert to markdown edit mode. 
Because if this factor we currently will not be using the GitHUb Wiki for 
documentation. **Public facing documentation will be presented in the *"Welcome 
To The Eagle Warriors Dev Team"* public facing repo.**
