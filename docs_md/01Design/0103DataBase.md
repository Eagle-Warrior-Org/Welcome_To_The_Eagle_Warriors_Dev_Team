Currently we have decided to use chromadb as the database to support our 
project. We are currently running chromadb locally. If you are familiar with 
docker a quick way is to install chromadb inside docker.

JUst be sure that 
you have a separate directory from chromadb to install the data that 
chromadb will store.
