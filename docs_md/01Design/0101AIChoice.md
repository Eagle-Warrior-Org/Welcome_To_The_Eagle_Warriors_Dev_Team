### 01.01 AI Choice ###

One of the decisions that have to be made is what AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
platform choice to start with. 

First we need to decide whether we go with a base model LLM (Large Language Model) 
and adapt it from there. 
Since training an LLM is resource expensive using an existing LLM as the base 
model seems to be the best course to start with IMO.

Then we have to decide which LLM we would use as a base model. Questions in 
this realm include:

1. open source, free or have a cost associated
2. Where will the LLM be hosted?  Will hosting run a cost and how much would 
   that be?
3. Will we be able to run tests on our own machines?

After some discussion we have decided to go with Google's Gemini. This may 
change in the future as we progress in development.
