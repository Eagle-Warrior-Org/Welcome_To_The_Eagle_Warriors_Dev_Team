### 01.01 AI Choice ###

One of the decisions that have to be made is what AI choose to start with. First we need to decide whether we go with a base model AI and adapt it from there. Since training an AI is resource expensive using an existing AI as the base model seems to be the best course to start with IMO.

Then we have to decide which AI we would use as a base model. Questions in this realm include:

1. open source, free or have a cost associated
2. Where will the AI be hosted?  Will hosting run a cost and how much wopuld that be?
3. Will we be able to run tests on our own machines?

Unfortunately I very little insight in the answer to the above 3 questions at this time.
