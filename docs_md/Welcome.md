This page is open to the veterans community. You don't have to know about how to build an AI, or how to do Software Developing. We would just like the Veteran Community to reach out and let us know what are some the challenges they face when finding resources for help. <br>
This helps our team find ways to incorporate that into our AI model, so we can best address those needs.
The AI model will be hosted on this website:
https://theeaglewarrior.org/<br>
<h3>IF YOU ARE A DEVELOPER, CODER or AI ENGINEER</h3>
Please reach out to our team if you would like to join in the efforts to help veterans. <br>
Eagle Warriors Organization is a public registered charity aimed to help veterans. There is a private repository and a volunteers connection site to keep track of your time while working with our team to develop a strong AI application aimed to assist veterans in need.<br> The Chat is open in the "Discussions" Icon above.<br>
