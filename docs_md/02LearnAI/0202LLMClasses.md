Some LLM class links I found learning to develop AI helpful.

[Kaggle - Google Course on AI ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?
list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es)- 5 part course that includes
technical whitepapers and Jupyter notebook assignments with Googles **Gemini**
AI. The links for the course are in the  *Description* under each day's video.
Actually I found the video to be based on the whitepaper for that day. Some
assignments in days 4 and 5 may require a paid subscription to Gemini but most
of the course work can be done with a free subscription.
