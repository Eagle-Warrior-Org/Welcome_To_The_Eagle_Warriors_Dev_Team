Some video links that I found learning to use AI helpful. 

[Unlock Hugging Face: Simplify AI with Transformers, LLMs, RAG, Fine-Tuning](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/huggingface)- 
This is a video presented by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). Covers 
how Hugging Face helps with using AI. Also mentions Kaggle datasets. Video Feb 2025.

[Research to Reality: Building Production Ready LLM Apps Users Can Trust 
with Rush Shahani](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/productionllm)- Video
12 Dec 2024. Not very helpful for starting out. But would be useful after LLM is
built and operating. Includes additional information on making LLMs trustworthy.
Also deals with setting up RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

[Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation with Abhinav Kimothi]
(https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/augmentedgeneration)- Using RAG technique to
assist an LLM by grounding the response with external resources. Video 12 September 2024 

[Understanding the LLM Development Cycle: Building, Training, and Fine-tuning 
with Sebastian Raschka](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/llmdevelopment)-
Video 5 June 2024. Since we have decided to start with a *Foundation Model LLM* 
the section on Building and Training may not be relevant to this project but 
these sections do provide some high level background. The section on 
*Fine-tuning* provides high level coverage that relates to this project. 
Fine-tuning also includes a bonus section which mentions *Preference 
Fine-tuning* 
and *Evaluation* of LLMs. Note that the video hangs up around 15 minutes but 
then picks up as the technical issues are resolved.
