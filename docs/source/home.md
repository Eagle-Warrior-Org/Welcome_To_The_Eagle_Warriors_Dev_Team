Welcome_To_The_Eagle_Warriors_Dev_Team wiki!

Unfortunately private repositories can not have a wiki on the free account. So in order to have a wiki there are 2 choices.

(1) have a github wiki on the public 'Welcome_To_The_Eagle_Warriors_Dev_Team' repo 
(2) not have a separate wiki - just use the 'Welcome_To_The Eagle_Warrios_Dev_Team as a wiki.

I would like to make a simple request to shorten this repo name. I simply prefer shorter names for the repos.

List below are some links with more info about the project placed in wiki.git public wiki

### *Have had a serious issue trying to establish relative links for the wiki page so I will be removing these wiki pages. Also I found that regular github source markdown documents seem to follow the relative links very well. Also some of these pages will be moved to a private repository since software design issues placed here will not be interesting to none developers.* ###
